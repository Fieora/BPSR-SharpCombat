# Installation

## Windows
1. Download and install NPCAP
   - https://npcap.com/#download
     - Why do I need this?
     - Npcap is a packet capture library for Windows. It allows applications to capture and transmit network packets bypassing the protocol stack, and has additional features such as support for loopback traffic and 802.11 Wi-Fi monitoring.
     - Also might theorretically work if you have WinPcap or Windivert installed as SharpPcap supports them all, but untested.
1. Install the installer [Here]("https://github.com/Fieora/BPSR-SharpCombat/releases/download/Release/BPSR.SharpCombat.Setup.0.1.0.exe")
   - The app should run on it's own after installing


## Linux
Untested, unbuilt yet, but coming soon. You shouldn't need any external installs as the packet capture library I created should work natively.
